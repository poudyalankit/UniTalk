## Setup and Running the Project

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. If you haven't set up a virtual environment, it's a good practice to do so:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask server:
   ```
   flask run --port=3001
   ```

With both servers running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access UniTalk.
